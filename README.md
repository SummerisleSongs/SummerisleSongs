- 👋 Hi, I’m @SummerisleSongs! I'm not a coder by trade but I'm loving it as a hobby. Getting a GitHub account seemed like the next logical step.
- 👀 I’m interested in web development: HTML, CSS and JS. Also Python. But basically I just want to learn as much as I can during my limited spare time.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML, CSS and JS through the Web Development Bootcamp (Colt Steele) on Udemy.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything and everything, as my skills improve.
